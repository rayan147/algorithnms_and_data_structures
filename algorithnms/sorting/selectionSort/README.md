### SelectionSort
 Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an 
 in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, 
 making it inefficient on large lists, and generally 
 performs worse than the similar insertion sort. 
 Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, 
 and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms 
 in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
 # Big O notation:
 Best: O(n2)
 Average: O(n2)
 Worst: O(n2)
 # Algorithm:
 1. Set the index of the minimum element to the first index
 2. Starting from the second element, find the minimum element in the list and swap it with the element at the first index.
 3. Set the first index to the second index and repeat the process.
